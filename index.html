              <h2><strong>THE ATIVAN HABIT</strong></h2>
              <p>In its early stages, <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/the-anxiety-of-ativan">Ativan</a> was never designed to be a drug to be taken long term by a user. Most pharmaceutical and medical experts agree that the longest a person should be on Ativan is two or three weeks. After that, there is a strong chance that the user could become addicted.</p>
              <p>This is why it is recommended that a person who is addicted to Ativan enter a rehabilitation center for detox and recovery where they will be supervised by a medical staff, or at least a qualified clinical team.</p>
              <h2><strong>HOW TO AVOID AN ATIVAN HABIT</strong></h2>
              <p>If you feel you have a penchant, or at least a fear you might become addicted to Ativan, especially when it is prescribed to you, double check with your doctor to make certain the prescription won&rsquo;t have an adverse effect on you, such as addiction.</p>
              <p>Another way to avoid a dependence on Ativan is to continually remind yourself of the drug&rsquo;s power, and that taking it for too long a period can result in your own dependence on the drug.</p>
              <p>The last, and possibly best way to avoid an Ativan habit is to seek out alternative medications and/or activities that can possibly replace the drug.</p>
              <p>Remember, Ativan is an anti-anxiety medication that helps you in uncomfortable situations that you might find stressful. The drug is also prescribed for those who suffer from narcolepsy, </p>
              <h2><strong>WHAT IF ME OR MY LOVED ONE IS ADDICTED TO AVITAN?</strong></h2>
              <p>Before suggesting to a friend, loved one, or even yourself that you might have a problem with Ativan, look out for the following signs of addiction.<br>
                Keep in mind that the most severe effects associated with Ativan occur during exposure to high doses of the drug. Those effects include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Depressed respiration</li>
                <li>Seizures</li>
                <li>Memory impairment</li>
                <li>Excessive sedation</li>
                <li>Tremors</li>
                <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
              </ul>
              <h2><strong>THE NEXT STEP</strong></h2>
              <p>Sensing that you or a loved one may have an addiction problem with Ativan is the first step. The next step is doing something about that potential addiction.</p>
              <p>Locate and consult a reputable <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/">treatment center</a> whose staff can give advice as to the type of treatment you or some close to you might need. Cases can vary from inpatient services to something less intense such as outpatient counseling that occurs a few times a week. </p>
              <p>Going this route with your rehabilitation is more comprehensive. It is also more likely to succeed in the long run.</p>
              <p>If in the least, you&rsquo;ll be in a safe and controlled environment, which considering the danger and gravity of an Ativan addiction, may not be such a bad proposal in order to regain your health. </p>
